[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/compare/9.2.7...448f514c50426834be9eab1e503225e552ed4051) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/releases)

- tweak one more default  
- change icon defaults and usages on jailer to be compatible with the now (finally) released BW jailer mod  
- adjust carrion throttle some, because it was overly strict and filtering first targets too  
- timer weaks to guardian to reset two timers on expose core, per todays hotfixes  
- Fix Lua error  
- Update commonlocal.cn.lua (#88)  
- Update localization.tw.lua (#87)  
- Update commonlocal.tw.lua (#86)  
- Only warn initial carrion targets for non targets. (personal always). This is a good middle ground of knowing initial targets but avoiding spam from it bouncing all about from handling it poorly  
- Tweak last, that kind of aggregation won't work, ultimately no way to avoid spam without gimping warning too much. it only spams if things going wrong, so just don't go wrong! ('ll i'll come up with cleaner solution later)  
- Fix a few observed bugs with lords of dread  
- Update alpha revision
