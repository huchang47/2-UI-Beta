	  This addon is aimed at helping players get the most out of their character by showing them the priority for their Attribute and Enhancement Stats.
	  This is not the first addon to offer this kind of information, but does appear to be the first with a button that you can click to show the information when you need it, and click again to hide.
	  Stat Priority information is changed automatically if you change Specs
